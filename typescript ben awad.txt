npm init -y // creates package.json
yarn add -D typescript //creates yarn.lock
npx tsc --init //creates tsconfig.json

//create a folder called src, and a file inside called index.ts

//to transpile it into javascript, in package.json inside of scripts change it to {"build": "tsc"},
yarn build //run from root, (in the same folder as yarn.lock), this will create an index.js file from the index.ts file
node src/index.js //run from root

//you need to compile and then run it every time, this is annoying so we use a module called ts-node
yarn add -D ts-node
//add to scripts, "start", "ts-node src/index.ts"
//this points it to a typescript file and responds to the "start" keyword
yarn start

yarn add -D ts-node-dev
//now change "start" value to "start" : "ts-node-dev --respawn src/index.ts"
yarn start

//or you can use nodemon
yarn add -D nodemon
//add to scripts the following, "dev": "nodemon --exec ts-node src/index.ts"
yarn add express
yarn add -D @types/express
yarn add -D @types/node
//anytime you add a package, you will also try adding @types/<nameofyourpackage>
//if your package does have a @types/ then you can make a folder called @types under src, and name it
//<modulename>.d.ts and inside write: declare module "<modulename>";
command+shift+p == restart typescript server, so that wierd bugs go away
